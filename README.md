# Egyptian_New_Currency
This project builds a complete image classification system for the new 2023 Egyptian currency using a custom Convolutional Neural Network. The model is implemented in Python with Keras inside a Jupyter Notebook. The system identifies different banknote denominations without using transfer learning or any pre-trained networks.
